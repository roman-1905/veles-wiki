# Mining pools

Mining in a pool helps miners to increase probability to find a block more
frequently as a group, and distribute shares of block rewards more quickly,
than it would be with solo mining as usually it is not practical to solo-mine,
not with small number of mining devices, on most of algos on Veles Core chain.

Following mining pools support Veles mining (in alphabetical order):
