# Veles Core Wiki
The repository to maintain Veles Core wiki articles and related assets.

## Guidelines
The wiki articles need to be authored in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format,
see [Sytnax Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for the syntax rules,
though there are few extensions supported on the top of the standard syntax. See [docs/](docs/) for more
information.
