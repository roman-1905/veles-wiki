* After installing Shadowsocks Client, **download [Veles Shadowsocks config file](https://explorer.veles.network/dapi/getShadowsocksConfig)**.  
[https://explorer.veles.network/dapi/getShadowsocksConfig](https://explorer.veles.network/dapi/getShadowsocksConfig)

***

***Step 2***  

* **Open Shadowsocks config** with your favorite editor. Config is located :  
`nano /etc/shadowsocks.json`

***Step 3***

***

***Step 4***

***

***Step 5***

***

***Step 6***  

* Fullfill the **"Password"** with password located in Shadowsocks Config.  

!!! caution "Experimental Warning"
	In testing phase is default password - **`password`**  

***

### Section C: Connect to Veles d-VPN with Shadowsocks 

***Step 1***  

* **To connect**, simply run **sslocal** command to start the ShadowSocks client tool:    
`sslocal -c /etc/shadowsocks/config.json`  

!!! tip "User Tip"
	When you see below message, it means the client tool has been started successfully.  
	`INFO: loading config from /etc/shadowsocks/config.json`  
	`2018-10-01 21:28:25 INFO loading libcrypto from libcrypto.so.1.1`  
	`2018-10-01 21:28:25 INFO starting local at 127.0.0.1:1080`    

***

### Section D: Test Shadowsocks Connection

***Step 1***  

* Once everything is installed, a simple check confirms everything is working properly. Without having a Shadowsocks connection enabled, open a browser and go to [DNSLeakTest](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/).
The site will return the IP address assigned by your internet service provider and as you appear to the rest of the world. To check your DNS settings through the same website, click on Extended Test and it will tell you which DNS servers you are using.
Now connect to your Shadowsocks client and refresh the browser. The completely different IP address of your Shadowsocks server should now appear. That is now how you appear to the world. Again, [DNSLeakTest's](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) **Extended Test** will check your DNS settings and confirm you are now using the DNS resolvers pushed by Veles dVPN.
